# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions

## 📌 Why this repo?
This repository contains my **LeetCode solutions**, structured by category.  
Each solution is implemented in Python and includes:
- **A well-commented approach directly in the `.py` file**
- **Time & space complexity analysis**
- **A quick recap (Nota Bene) for revision**

## 📂 Structure
- `Arrays/` → Array-based problems (Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, etc.)
- Future categories (Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.) will be added as I progress.

## 📈 Progress
✔️ **Problems solved: 5**  
✔️ **Key patterns learned:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Hash Maps  
✔️ **Target:** 100+ problems before my FAANG internship applications
