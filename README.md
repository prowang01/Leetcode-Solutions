# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions

## 📌 Why this repo?
This repository contains my **LeetCode solutions**, structured by category.  
Each solution is implemented in Python and includes:
- **A well-commented approach directly in the `.py` file**
- **Time & space complexity analysis**
- **A quick recap (Nota Bene) for revision**

## 📂 Structure
- `Arrays/` → Array-based problems (Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, etc.)  
- `Graphs/` → Algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra  
- `Dynamic_Programming/` → Classic DP problems (Climbing Stairs, Coin Change, etc.)  

## 📈 Progress
✔️ **Problems solved: 5**  
✔️ **Key patterns learned:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Hash Maps  
✔️ **Target:** 100+ problems before my FAANG internship applications  

📌 **All solutions contain an explanation inside the `.py` file, so no extra README per problem!**

## 🔥 Featured Problems
1. ✅ [Two Sum](Arrays/two_sum.py)  
2. ✅ [Majority Element](Arrays/169_Majority_Element.py)  
3. ✅ [Rotate Array](Arrays/Rotate-Array.py) (In Progress)  

## 🎯 Goals
I am **pursuing two ambitious goals**:  
1. **Professional Basketball Career** 🏀  
2. **Internships at FAANG Companies** 💻  

This repository serves as part of my **FAANG preparation**, building a strong foundation in **Software Engineering & Problem-Solving**.
